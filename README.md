#### I've set up Tailwind CSS for styling in the frontend project, but some pages were causing issues, so some files have separate CSS files.

#### Because of the privacy policy page, some browsers can cause issues while running the front-end, if such issue persist , please use a different browser ex:- chrome. So far I've seen that brave adblocker has caused this issue other than that the project runs absolutely fine on all other broswer.
